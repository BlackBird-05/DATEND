DATEND is a macOS-based application written in python 3.14.2. 
This project is built as a tool to assist in essay grading for teachers teaching International Baccalaureate (IB) English, specifically for Paper 2. 
DATEND is able to analyse student essays in the form of .docx files and summarise literary devices, themes, and other important components of a strong essay for the teacher.
Additionally, DATEND will also highlight these instances for ease of viewing.
This project is meant to be customisable with a layer of abstraction so teachers can feel free to add their own list of literary devices, themes, etc that DATEND will look out for.
DATEND also utilises a trained Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model (pickled for packaging) that is trained on previous essays to suggest a grade based on the above analysis.
Disclaimer: DATEND may not be necessarily accurate in determining a grade so teachers are suggested to vet through the essays and use the grade as a signpost.

Shoutout to the IB English Guys for comissioning this project!
